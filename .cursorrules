# Minnesota Fraud Clicker Game - Project Rules

## Always Read Context First

Before making changes to this project, always read `/docs/NEWS_REVIEW.md` for essential context about the real-world scandal this game satirizes.

## Project Overview

This is a satirical idle/clicker game based on the real Minnesota welfare fraud scandal—potentially the largest in American history.

### Key Facts

- **Scale**: Up to $9 billion estimated stolen (half of $18B in federal funds since 2018)
- **57+ convictions** with sentences up to 28 years
- **Viral exposure**: Nick Shirley's investigation video got 100M+ views

### Programs Exploited (Game Themes)

- **Feeding Our Future** - Fake meal distribution during COVID (largest case)
- **CCAP** - Child Care Assistance Program (phantom children, empty daycares)
- **EIDBI** - Autism therapy services (fake diagnoses, inflated billing)
- **Medicaid/PCA** - Personal Care Attendant fraud (nonexistent services)
- **Housing Stabilization** - Fraudulent billing for housing assistance
